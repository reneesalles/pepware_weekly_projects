Happy Monday Marcos Renee!
Jules is a drawbridge operator.  Their job is to communicate with boats on the river when the bridge will open and how long the bridge needs to be open.

Jules has been asked by a city planner to keep track of how many cars and large trucks drive over the bridge during certain times of the day.  For a half-hour every day Jules needs to keep track of:
How many vehicles drive over the bridge
How many of those vehicles are cars
How many of those vehicles are semi-trucks
Since Jules still has to keep track of the boats on the river, they would like to have a simple program that will:
Keep a tally of the total number of vehicles
Keep a tally of the number of large trucks
Keep a tally of the number of cars
Be easy to use while watching the road
Output the totals in a text file.
On way to be easy to use while watching the road would be to have a simple terminal app that keeps track of the number of times the user presses ‘t’ and ‘c’.  A more ambitious way could be a mobile app or website that has two very large buttons on either side of the screen.

If you’re feeling ambitious, add the ability for the user to add new custom vehicle type to track.
